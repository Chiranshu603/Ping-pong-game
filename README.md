# Ping-pong-game
Game using scratch

My scratch project is a two-player ping-pong game. The paddle on the left uses w to move upwards and s to move downwards. 
The paddle on the right uses upward and downward arrow keys for movement. To start the game press the green flag. 
To stop and reset the game press the space key on the keyboard. The scoreboard shows both players' scores. 
The player scores when the ball touches the same color paddle line.

This project is part of CS50 program.
